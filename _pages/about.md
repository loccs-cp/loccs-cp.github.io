My research focuses on **side-channel analysis and countermeasures in cryptographic systems**, as well as **information leakage detection in cryptographic modules**.  
I have proposed a series of side-channel analysis and detection techniques targeting real-world cryptographic systems, such as **USIM cards, dedicated cryptographic chips, and Bluetooth Low Energy**.  

In the past five years, I have published **10+ papers** in top-tier conferences and journals in the field of cryptographic engineering, including **TCHES, TIFS, DAC, ESORICS, JCST, TVLSI**.  

I also led the development of:  
- **SCAnalyzer Pro**, a side-channel analysis software tool  
- **MCU information leakage acquisition device** and **multi-protocol acquisition device**  
- **International NIST lightweight cryptography side-channel evaluation** (software/hardware implementations)  

As a core member, I have participated in **NSFC projects** and **State Grid Corporation research projects**.  
My contributions have been recognized with awards including:  
- **First Prize, Shanghai Technological Invention Award (2023)**  
- **Second Prize, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Scientific Research Achievement Award (2023)**
